Grow your business by gathering user feedback. Takes 2 minutes to install and it’s 100% free.  

== Description ==

Feedback Cat is the first WordPress plugin that lets you read people’s minds. 

Well, sort of. 

When you use our plugin you’ll be able to know what your users are really thinking. 

Unfortunately, though, “reading minds” here doesn’t mean doing anything out of the X-Men movies. We’re not talking mind reading in that sense.

Instead, Feedback Cat lets you create surveys and get direct user feedback. With this feedback, you will know what your users are thinking. You can then use their thoughts from the survey to grow your business more effectively.

So, do you have 2 minutes? 

That’s how “long” it takes to set up Feedback Cat. You’ll find complete installation instructions below. But don’t expect anything long or time-consuming. It really is easy to get up and running with Feedback Cat. You can do it in 2 minutes. Seriously!

Then there’s the whole issue of price. 

Brace yourself. Sit down if you need to. Stop chewing a chicken bone, so you won’t choke on it.

Feedback Cat is...

FREE!

Libre. Gratis. 免費.    

You can set up your survey and get powerful user feedback at NO charge. 

Speaking of free - Feedback Cat is proudly 100%, bull**** free. 

That means you can use our plugin without being harassed by annoying up-sells. 

We’re NOT going to be cheapskates and only let you do X number of surveys for free.  

We also respect you enough to NOT shove a branding link inside your feedback forms. It’s your survey, after all. We’re just along for the ride.

Got all that? 

Hope so. Here are just a few more things you need to know.

First, once you set up Feedback Cat, make sure your email inbox is ready. All user feedback is going straight to the inbox - meaning you don’t want a survey response to accidentally get flagged as spam.

You should also know that Feedback cat is completely open source. Feel free to download our code and modify it to your heart’s content. 

For the coders reading this, here’s a link to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/davidhme/feedback-cat), where you can check out the code -- 

For the non-coders, there’s no need to now go Google what a “GitHub repository” is. You can use Feedback Cat without knowing how to code. 

As long as you can publish a blog post in WordPress, you’ll have no trouble using our plugin to set up surveys. We’ve purposely made it this easy so anyone can gather user or customer feedback. Whether you’re a blogger, entrepreneur, marketer, or something else entirely - you’ll be happy to know that Feedback Cat “just works”.      

That does it for our description of Feedback Cat. 

WAIT!

There is one more thing, actually. 

In the spirit of getting feedback, we would love to hear from you. You don’t have to fill out a survey. But it would be awesome to connect with you and get your thoughts.      

Simply post in the "Surveys by Feedback Cat" support forums and let us know what you think of this plugin. Which features would you like to see next?

What? You mean Feedback Cat isn’t perfect?

Yeah, unfortunately. But hey we’re working on it, alright?

So keep calm and carry on ♔.

Because this entire section will help you with any problems you have.

**Problem: I'm not receiving survey answers via email.**

Solution: Our plugin, Feedback Cat, uses the `wp_mail` function - (more info here)[https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_mail]. 

Depending on your server setup, deliverability of survey results might not always be perfect. 

If that’s the case , here's how you can solve the problem:

1. Check your spam folder.
2. If the email isn't in your spam folder, ask you host if sending emails is possible from your server.
3. If you’re still lost, try setting up Mailgun or Mandrill for better email deliverability.
