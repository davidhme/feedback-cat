This survey plugin lets you create modal feedback froms in minutes.

== Description ==
Set up modal feedback survey forms with ease.

= Setup =
1. Go to Feedback Cat in your WP Admin menu 
2. Build your survey
3. Set status to "Active"
4. Survey submissions will be sent straight to your WP admin email

= Troubleshooting =
**I'm not receiving survey answers via email.**
This plugin uses the `wp_mail` function ((more info here)[https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_mail]), depending on your server setup deliverability might not always be perfect.

Step 1: Check your spam folder.
Step 2: If the email isn't in your spam folder, please contact your host and double check if sending emails is possible from your server.
Step 3: If this doesn't help, try setting up Mailgun or Mandrill for better email deliverability.

= Support =
This plugin is a small side-project (we have a bunch of (commercial plugins)[https://fatcatapps.com/] to support), so we can't guarantee super fast response time. If you encounter issues, please post them in the support forum which we will check ocassionally.
