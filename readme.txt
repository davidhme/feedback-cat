This survey plugin lets you create modal feedback froms in minutes.

== Description ==
Set up modal feedback survey forms with ease.

= Setup =
1. Go to Feedback Cat in your WP Admin menu 
2. Build your survey
3. Set status to "Active"
4. Survey submissions will be sent straight to your WP admin email

= Troubleshooting =
**Problem: I'm not receiving survey answers via email.**

Solution: This plugin uses the `wp_mail` function - (more info here)[https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_mail]. Depending on your server setup deliverability might not always be perfect. Here's how to solve this problem:

1. Check your spam folder.
2. If the email isn't in your spam folder, please contact your host and double check if sending emails is possible from your server.
3. If this doesn't help, try setting up Mailgun or Mandrill for better email deliverability.

= Support =
If you encounter issues, please post them in the support forum.
